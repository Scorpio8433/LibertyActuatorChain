# LibertyActuatorChain  

## Overview  
LibertyActuatorChain is a decentralized governance framework designed to empower blue-collar workers through ownership and financial equity. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a sustainable ecosystem that prioritizes transparency, autonomy, and community-driven decision-making.  

## Core Features

- **Financial Empowerment:** ERC-20 token model supporting liquidity and revenue generation.  
- **Scalable Integration:** Smart contracts designed to expand into various industries, including oil & gas.  

## Vision  
Our long-term goal is to **establish LARS Bank** as a community-owned financial institution backed by **Bitcoin and Ethereum**, offering unlimited **DeFi growth opportunities**. We aim to integrate **symbolic and functional tools** that align with our values while ensuring **economic sustainability**.
